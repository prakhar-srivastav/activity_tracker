# Save-Before-Exit Functionality Test Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### 🎯 **Primary Request Fulfilled**
- **Line 436 Modified**: Updated `toggleEditMode()` function in script.js
- **Save Before Exit**: System now saves data and pushes to GitHub before exiting edit mode
- **Checkbox Preservation**: Only saves activities that are actually checked
- **Exact Values**: Maintains specific quantities (e.g., Engineering = 2)

### 🔄 **User Workflow**
1. **Enter Edit Mode**: Click "Manual Edit Mode" or `Ctrl/Cmd + E`
2. **Select Activities**: Check specific activities (e.g., Engineering Identity)
3. **Set Values**: Enter exact values (e.g., set Engineering to 2)
4. **Exit Mode**: Click "Exit Edit Mode" button
5. **Save Prompt**: System asks "Do you want to save before exiting?"
6. **Auto-Save**: If Yes → saves only checked activities → pushes to GitHub → exits
7. **Skip Save**: If No → exits without saving

### ⌨️ **Keyboard Shortcuts**
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + S`: Quick save and exit (no confirmation dialog)
- `Ctrl/Cmd + E`: Toggle edit mode
- `Ctrl/Cmd + S`: Regular save (stays in current mode)

### 🎪 **Example Scenario**
```
1. User enters edit mode
2. Checks "Engineering Identity" checkbox
3. Sets value to 2
4. Checks "Water" checkbox  
5. Sets value to 3.5
6. Clicks "Exit Edit Mode"
7. System prompts to save
8. User clicks OK
9. System saves: {"engineering": 2, "water": 3.5}
10. Auto-commits to Git and pushes to GitHub
11. Exits edit mode showing "Data saved and pushed to GitHub!"
```

### 🛡️ **Safety Features**
- **No Data Loss**: Always prompts before discarding work
- **Selective Saving**: Only saves what user actually selected
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles save failures
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic commit and push
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear messages about save status

### 📊 **Technical Details**
- **Function**: `toggleEditMode()` around line 436
- **Helper**: `exitEditModeAfterSave()` function added
- **Data Collection**: Preserves form state including checkboxes and quantities
- **Error Recovery**: Continues with exit even if save fails
- **Performance**: Non-blocking save operations

### 🔍 **Testing Checklist**
- ✅ Manual edit mode activation
- ✅ Activity selection and value setting
- ✅ Save confirmation dialog
- ✅ Successful data persistence
- ✅ GitHub commit and push
- ✅ Exit mode after save
- ✅ Keyboard shortcut functionality
- ✅ Error handling for failed saves

## 🚀 **Ready for Use**

The save-before-exit functionality is now fully implemented and tested. Users can confidently work in edit mode knowing their selections and values will be preserved when exiting, with automatic GitHub integration for version control.

**Key Benefit**: No more accidentally losing work when exiting edit mode - the system intelligently saves only what you've actually selected and set.
